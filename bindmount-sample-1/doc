 for testing this application run this
go to inside this folder
and then run docker container with 
-v 

docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve

where $(pwd) is a current directory

you have to add file in _post
write date first and give name 
example 2017-03-05-ratan
and then refresh browser and you can see the post as per date 

so it shows that when you use bind mount what you change on host machine will reflect on runtime on container
